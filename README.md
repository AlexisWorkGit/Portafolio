1.  Inspect element - when editing html and css files utilities like
    [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com) (free firefox plugin) are great
    helpers. With them you can easily find element style, even the
    stylesheet name and line number where the inspected style rule is
2.  Edit html/css/js/php files - use your favorite text editor. Editor,
    that highlights syntax is good choice,
    [Pspad](http://www.pspad.com/) (free) or
    [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (free) might be enough
3.  View pages - any common browser like [Mozilla
    Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (free)
4.  Upload on server - look for some FTP program -
    [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (free)

[Installation](#Installation)[Back to Top](#html)
=================================================

To install Gilber on your web server, download the files and unzip them
to the local disk on your computer. Inside the extracted folder you will
see `Gilber` folder. Using an FTP Client (such as Filezilla or Total
Commander), upload all of the contents of the `Gilber` folder to your
server.

You must have JavaScript enabled in your browser. Also, a web server is
required for the video background - testing it locally (unless using a
development server such as Wamp or Mamp server) will not work.

> If a user does not have JavaScript enabled in their browser, the site
> does not load and a message is displayed informing them of the
> problem.

> This is not a WordPress theme, so cannot be installed with WordPress.

[AJAX Contact Form](#AjaxContactForm)[Back to Top](#html)
=========================================================

`Gilber/handler.php`
